"We are the SpaceX software team, ask us anything!","Hi r/spacex!

We're a few of the SpaceX team members who helped develop and deploy software that flew Dragon and powered the touchscreen displays on our human spaceflight demonstration mission (aka Crew Demo-2). Now that Bob and Doug are on board the International Space Station and Dragon is in a quiescent state, we are here to answer any questions you might have about Dragon, software and working at SpaceX.

**We are**:

* Jeff Dexter - I run Flight Software and Cybersecurity at SpaceX
* Josh Sulkin - I am the software design lead for Crew Dragon
* Wendy Shimata - I manage the Dragon software team and worked fault tolerance and safety on Dragon
* John Dietrick - I lead the software development effort for Demo-2
* Sofian Hnaide - I worked on the Crew Displays software for Demo-2
* Matt Monson - I used to work on Dragon, and now lead Starlink software
